# Introduction 

This Analysis project explores the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians, focusing on critical safety metrics like time-to-collision (TTC) and braking demand . Through thorough data exploration, visualization, and feature engineering, this analysis provides actionable insights to the data.
The analysis investigates vehicle-pedestrian interactions by leveraging real-world data. It explores metrics such as longitudinal distances, relative velocities, and braking demand, which are used to calculate critical metrics for understanding safety dynamics. The study uses Python for data analysis and visualization.
This project is Analysis of the odometry data that comes out of the Vehicle and then validating it according to the International standards. 
The main goal pf the analysis was to check whether the vehicle is working according to the International standards , for which the metrics that were calculated were Breaking demand and Time to collision.
